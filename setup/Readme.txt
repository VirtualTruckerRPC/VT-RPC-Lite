Thank you for installing VT-RPC Lite!
VT-RPC Lite is a lighter version of the tool to let others see your current job, truck, etc. using Discord Rich Presence!  

Here's our Discord server for support: https://discord.gg/Zt49WDH  
ETCARS 0.15.386 is required for the RPC to work, older versions will not work.  

Things to note
==============================
* IF YOU HAVE THE FULL VT-RPC, UNINSTALL IT BEFORE USING THIS!
* TruckersMP has their own Rich Presence which needs to be disabled in MP Settings!
* Due to a few problems with previous ETCARS, you will need to install ETCARS 0.15.386 from our installer.
